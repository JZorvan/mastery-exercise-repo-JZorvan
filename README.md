## Hints

- Find what's missing
- Ensure the students in your database are unique. What does the first argument of the `AddOrUpdate` method represent? Can you come up with an expression to check for uniqueness?
- `NameGenerator` can choose from a predefined list of names and majors. Is there a way to randomly select an item from a list?
